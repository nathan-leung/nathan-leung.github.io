    		<h4>Platform</h4>
            <p>This project was built on a ?????? microcontroller, which displayed the game on a peripheral LCD screen. The controller was running a real-time operating system.</p>

            <h4>Object of the game</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>This is a top-down zombie survival game, where the player tries to survive as long as possible.</li>
              <li>The player uses a joystick to move his or her character displayed on the LCD screen.</li>
              <li>Every so often, a zombie, which are programmed to move towards the player, will spawn. The player dies if one of these zombies manage to touch the player</li>
              <li>Bombs that the player can pickup are randomly generated around the screen.</li>
              <li>The player can detonate these bombs to kill all zombies in the immediate vicinity of the player</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The longer the player survives, the faster the zombies spawn, and the faster the zombies become.</p>
            <p> The player has one life. Score is based on the number of zombies the player has killed at the end of the game</p>

            <h4>How it works</h4>
            <p>The game is built on a real-time-operating system, and uses multiple threads to represent various components of the game. There are four main tasks, which are: the human task, the zombie task, the bomb pickup task, and the bomb detonation task. </p>
                    <h5>Human Task</h5>
                    <p>This task simply keeps track of player position, and reads the joystick information to move and redraw the player in an updated position.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Zombie Task</h5>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each individual zombie is controlled by its own task, which is created as each zombie spawns.</li>
                            <li>A zombie will spawn in the corner farther from the player based on when a dynamic timer is reached (a timer which decreases as playtime increase, so zombie spawns are more frequent).</li>
                            <li>Each zombie is programmed to move in the direction of the player at all times.</li>
                            <li>
                              The longer a zombie is alive, the faster it becomes over time. A zombies starting speed (how fast it is when it spawns) also increases the longer the player is alive.
                          </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Bomb Pickup Task</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bombs are represented as purple dos on the screen and will disappear when the player touches one (as long as the players bomb capacity is not full).</li>
                            <li>Bombs are randomly generatored to appear everywhere on the screen</li>
                            <li>The number of bombs the player currently has is represented by the LEDs, which are updated immediately upon each pickup and explosion.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h5>Bomb Detonation Task</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li> The player can detonate one of their bombs by pressing the button. </li>
                            <li> This button fires an interrupt which allows the bomb task to run. </li>
                            <li> The task animates an explosion centred on player, and will kill all zombies which are within a 50 pixel radius. (The player itself, however, will be unharmed!) </li>
                            <li> This action will decrement the number of bombs displayed appropriately. </li>
                        </ul>
